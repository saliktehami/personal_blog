Hey there! I'm Salik Tehami, the voice behind this blog. As a medical student turned MBA candidate, I'm on a mission to unravel the complexities of healthcare business.
My journey began during hospital rotations, where I found myself fascinated by the intricate ecosystem of healthcare. How does the hospital generate revenue? What's the patient experience like? How do all the pieces fit together? These questions ignited a passion that led me to take a break from med school and dive into an MBA program in the heart of New York City.
Profit Vitals is my digital playground where I explore and share insights about the business side of healthcare. From hospital operations to pharmaceutical strategies, insurance intricacies to the impact of legislation - I'm here to learn and grow, taking you along for the ride.

I'm no expert (yet!), but I'm eager to learn and improve my writing skills. This blog is as much about my personal growth as it is about sharing knowledge. So expect a fresh, curious perspective on healthcare business, sprinkled with occasional insights from my days as a management consultant.
When I'm not geeking out over healthcare systems, you'll find me serving aces on the tennis court, doing laps in the pool, or cheering for my favorite NBA and NFL teams. I'm also a tech enthusiast and love exploring the concrete jungle of NYC.
Let's navigate the business of healing together. 

Join me on this journey, and don't hesitate to connect on LinkedIn or X (formerly Twitter) for more healthcare business banter!
