Welcome to Profit Vitals! This blog is my platform to explore and share insights into the fascinating world of healthcare business. As a medical student, I realized that our education rarely covered the intricate ecosystem of our industry and our roles within it. My goal is to bridge that gap by learning as much as I can about healthcare business and sharing my discoveries with you.

Before diving into the world of healthcare, I worked as a management consultant, where I had the opportunity to collaborate on several healthcare projects. Currently, I'm on leave from medical school to pursue an MBA in New York City, dedicating this year to immersing myself in the healthcare business landscape and sharing my journey with you.

I don't claim to be a technical expert, but I am passionate about learning and writing about what I find interesting. This blog is my outlet for improving my written communication skills while exploring topics that captivate me.

My current interests lie in hospital business, pharmaceutical business, insurance business, and the impact of legislation on the healthcare industry. You can expect to see posts on these subjects and more as I navigate this complex and dynamic field.

While I am still discovering my unique selling points, I believe my background as a medical student and former management consultant, combined with my current MBA studies, provides a well-rounded perspective on healthcare business. I aim to offer insights that are both informative and practical, drawing from my diverse experiences and continuous learning.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and follow me on X (formerly Twitter) for more updates and discussions.

Thank you for joining me on this journey through the business side of healthcare!
